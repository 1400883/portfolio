A well-known simple analog game cabinet from the 90's I tried to replicate as a part of a portfolio to an Introductory Course to Web Technologies in university. I had barely touched JavaScript at the time but already fallen in love. As someone coming from procedural background, I was totally oblivious to OOP design, which should become obvious by looking at sources.
