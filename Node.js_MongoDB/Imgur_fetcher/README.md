Imgur viral fetcher is a simple viral image metadata retrieval web app. Finished as a qualification task for a job, it was my first date with MongoDB.

Assignment consisted of implementing a node-based application that retrieves viral image metadata using Imgur API. Metadata was then stored in a local MongoDB instance. The app was supposed to allow performing searches on metadata, returning results as images. Emphasis was to be in the back-end, the front-end serving only the purpose of a simple GUI interface.

Database unit tests were also carried out, using Mocha.

A live copy of the application should be running in the AWS cloud @ http://35.156.228.64:3000/. For new installations, the app utilizes features introduced recently in MongoDB, so you should aim at server version no older than 3.4.
