The purpose of LioneZZ AdFree Spotify was to get rid of audio 
advertisements in Spotify. The main objective was to accomplish 
the task without user interaction other than running the executable.
The program has been tested with 32-bit XP/Vista/7.

Upon executing the program the main application window with 
various options to customize text display behavior appear. 
USE TEXT DISPLAY checkbox (de)activates the song name display feature 
at the beginning of each song. You may also choose the font including 
standard font effects as well as text outline color to help the text 
stand out on screen backgrounds of different colors. Text display 
duration determines how long the song name will be visible at the 
beginning of each song. You generally want to set text justification 
to reflect the text position on the screen, i.e. one of the Right-
justification settings if you want the text to appear near the right 
edge of your display. Finally, there are numbered boxes that 
represent the physical monitor layout in your system. Use mouse to 
position the text object as you wish. Clicking the Preview button 
displays an example text string in the position currently selected.

The actual ad-blocking feature is completely automatic and will be
functional instantly once the application has been started.

Closing the main user interface does not quit the program. You can 
still get access to the window via right-clicking the system tray icon. 
Exiting the application also happens via the tray menu. Current 
settings are automatically saved in an .ini file in the directory the
application is located.

The primary advantage of LioneZZ AdFree Spotify is that its ad-blocking 
feature doesn't require special attention from a user after being 
activated - no song blacklists, no whitelists, no manual hotkey 
presses to bypass an ongoing advertisement, nothing but waiting for 
the silenced ad to finish playing.
